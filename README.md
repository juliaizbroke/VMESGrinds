# VMES Grinds - Coding Problem Solving Program

## Description
VMES grinds is a program for us to reconnect with problem solving skills in coding and to get the most out of our collaborative effort.

## Structure
During the program run, each member will be assigned one day to:
* Find a problem 
* Solve
* Prepare the theoretical background (intuition, how to solve it, how the solution was optimised etc)
* Explain it back to the team
* Share the resources - canva, github

## Expected Outcome from the Program
* To prepare us for the future interview
* To improve explanation skills
* To refresh our knowledge with collaborative effort

## Current Direction
* Currently, we are in pilot stage, decided to grow beyond.
* We will start off with 5 pilot runs.
* Start with 4 easy, 2 medium and 1 hard problem for each run.

## Commitment
* Encourage to fully participate in 2 pilot runs.

## Program Plan
1. **Sunday - 9 to 11 PM** (Theory + 1 or 2 problems) - 2 [2M]
2. **Tuesday - 9 to 10 PM** (3 Problems) - 3 [3M]
3. **Thursday - 9 to 10 PM** (2 Problems) + Interview review or guest speaker - 2 [1H + 1M]
